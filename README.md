# Assignment-Codes
All codes related to complex networks assignments
first part involved implementing random walks for training corpus and node2vec to generate node embeddings and then trained logistic regression to classify node labels
second part involved implementing Graph Convolutional Networks to perform node classification by taking node features as input to model,embeddings get updated by applying nonlinear activation to linear combination of neighbouring node embeddings and that node itself.Final embedding of each node is a probability distribution across classes.
third part involved trying different models such as GAT,GIN and R-GCN to perform node classification
